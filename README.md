# DualSPHysics for FreeCAD
DualSPHysics for FreeCAD is a module intended for use with the simulator [DualSPHysics](http://dual.sphysics.org/) and [FreeCAD](http://www.freecadweb.org/?lang=es_ES)

DSPH for FreeCAD enables de user to create cases with solids and liquids and exports it to a DualSPHysics compatbile format. In addition, it does the hard work for the user, generating the case with GenCase automatically, simulating in FreeCAD and exporting to VTK to view the results. All of that without having to enter any command.
